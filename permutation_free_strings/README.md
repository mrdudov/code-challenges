# Permutation-free Strings

[Kata on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b53be0bf10a4b39300001f)

## Problem Description

You build a string of length `l` which entirely consists
of `n` types of characters `1, 2, ..., n`.

Let's define such a string "permutation-free" if it has no
substring which is a permutation of `12...n` (in other words,
substring of length n which contains all types of characters
exactly once).

For `n = 2`, it means that `12` and `21` are not allowed, so the
only possible permutation-free strings are `11...1` and `22...2`.

For `n = 3`, strings like `1111`, `3311`, and `1223` are
permutation-free, while `1232`, `3231`, and `3122` are not.

How many permutation-free strings can you make, given the values
of `n` and `l`? Since your answer will be very large, please give
your answer modulo `12345787`.

## Constraints

* `3 <= n <= 5`

* `n <= l <= 100`

The inputs will be always valid integers.

## Examples

    permutation_free(3, 3) == 3 ** 3 - 3! == 21
    permutation_free(3, 4) == 51
    permutation_free(3, 5) == 123
    permutation_free(3, 10) == 10089

    permutation_free(4, 4) == 4 ** 4 - 4! = 232
    permutation_free(4, 5) == 856
    permutation_free(4, 10) == 3160

    permutation_free(5, 5) == 5 ** 5 - 5! = 3005
    permutation_free(5, 6) == 14545
    permutation_free(5, 10) == 8001745

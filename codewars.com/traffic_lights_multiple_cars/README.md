# Traffic lights multiple cars

## Description

### Overview

A character string represents a city road.

Cars travel on the road obeying the traffic lights..

Legend:

    . = Road
    C = Car
    G = GREEN traffic light
    O = ORANGE traffic light
    R = RED traffic light

Something like this:
CCC.G...R...

### Rules

#### Simulation

At each iteration:

* the lights change (according to the traffic light rules), then
* the car moves, obeying the car rules

#### Traffic Light Rules

Traffic lights change color as follows:

* GREEN for 5 time units... then
* ORANGE for 1 time unit... then
* RED for 5 time units....
* ... and repeat the cycle

#### Car Rules

* Cars travel left to right on the road, moving 1 character position per time unit
* Cars can move freely until they come to a traffic light. Then:
* if the light is GREEN they can move forward (temporarily occupying the same cell as the light)
* if the light is ORANGE then they must stop (if they have already entered the intersection they can continue through)
* if the light is RED the car must stop until the light turns GREEN again
* It is illegal to queue across an intersection. In other words, DO NOT enter an intersection unless you can see there is safe passage through it and out the other side!

## Kata Task

Given the initial state of the road, return the states for all iterations of the simulation.

### Function input

* road = the road array
* n = how many time units to simulate (n >= 0)

### Output

* An array containing the road states at every iteration (including the initial state)
* Note: If a car occupies the same position as a traffic light then show only the car

#### Notes

* There are 1 or more cars
* There are 0 or more traffic lights
* For the initial road state:
* cars can start anywhere except in the middle of intersections
* traffic lights are either GREEN or RED, and are at the beginning of their countdown cycles
* There are no reaction delays - when the lights change the car drivers will react immediately!
* If a car goes off the end of the road it just disappears from view
* There will always be some road between adjacent traffic lights
* If there is a traffic light at the end of the road then its exit is never blocked
* You cannot see beyond the car in front of you, so you cannot anticipate a gap that does not yet exist

### Example

Run simulation for 16 time units

#### Input

* road = "CCC.G...R..."
* n = 16

#### Result

    [
        "CCC.G...R...", // 0 initial state as passed
        ".CCCG...R...", // 1
        "..CCC...R...", // 2 show 1st car, not the green light
        "..CCGC..R...", // 3 2nd car cannot enter intersection because 1st car blocks the exit
        "...CC.C.R...", // 4 show 2nd car, not the green light
        "...COC.CG...", // 5 3rd car stops for the orange light
        "...CR.C.C...", // 6
        "...CR..CGC..", // 7
        "...CR...C.C.", // 8
        "...CR...GC.C", // 9
        "...CR...O.C.", // 10
        "....C...R..C", // 11 3rd car can proceed
        "....GC..R...", // 12
        "....G.C.R...", // 13
        "....G..CR...", // 14
        "....G..CR...", // 15
        "....O...C..."  // 16
    ]
